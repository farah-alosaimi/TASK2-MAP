# TASK2-MAP
## map by Turtlebot3
* 1- go to http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/ 
* 2- enter to the PCsetup from Quick Start Guide 
* 3- run all the code in that page then from the simulation 
* 4- run all the code in Gazebo Simulation and SLAM Simulation 
* 5- i faced a problem when i tried to Launch Simulation World the simulation window closed for no reason so i solved this problem by using this code:
~~~python
$ export SVGA_VGPU10=0
~~~ 
* it opened correctly when i retry to open the simulation 
* last thing is that i complete the map by moving the robot using the following keystrokes w s a d and then i save the map.
